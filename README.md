## About
It is a Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem implementation which includes encryption, decryption and attacking sides. So, it can cipher the message texted then can decipher like a receiver or can crack like a man-in-the-middle-attacker. Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem is known as a crackable with using LLL based lattice reduction. libLLL library is used for reduction algorithm, can be found on [here](https://github.com/kutio/liblll/blob/master/liblll.py)

## Motivation
I want to learn something about cryptography and also, I've never done an implementation in python. Finally, I started.

## Features
  - One dimensional knapsack solution with back-tracking
  - Different deciphering choice that being an attacker or a receiver
  - Letters, digits and punctuations are supported

## Installation
Run the following code 

```git clone https://github.com/kahramani/knapsack.git```

Then run ```python tester.py```
